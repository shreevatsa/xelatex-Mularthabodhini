# XeLaTeX source files for "Mularthabodhini" book

These are the LaTeX (XeLaTeX) source files by Nityanand Misra, for the book "Mularthabodhini":

> श्रीभक्तमाल (मूलार्थबोधिनी टीका सहित)  
> Śrībhaktamāla (Mūlārthabodhinī Ṭīkā Sahita)

a commentary written by _Jagadguru Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya_.

See details about the book [here, for instance](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/RK6qWmIeBYc/m/_Qxlwq56AAAJ).

As mentioned in the notice linked above, these source files have been made available under the GNU General Public License Version 3.

I have uploaded these source files here because of my interest in TeX/LaTeX/typesetting, 
and because this example of a complete book in the Devanagari script, typeset with TeX-related technology,
may be useful to anyone else attempting to typeset books in Indian languages.

The [`src/` directory in this repository](https://github.com/shreevatsa/xelatex-Mularthabodhini/tree/main/src)
contains the actual source files, along with instructions on how to compile them.
